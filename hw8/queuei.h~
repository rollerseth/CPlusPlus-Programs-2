#Program Name: assign61.cpp

#Assignment Number: 6.1

#Problem: Will create a abstract data type(ADT)
queue that will hold structs that contain
an integer and a pointer to a queueNode. This queue 
is a circular one

#Flow: The layout is all the function declarations
with comments

#Sources:
*http://mathcs.wilkes.edu/~bracken/cs226/
*link above was used for the skeleton files

I have thoroughly tested my code and it works properly
