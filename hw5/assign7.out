Problem: An binary tree has been implemented 
so that users can modify the tree's contents.

1. Add an element to the binary tree
2. Delete an element from the tree
3. Display level i of the tree
4. Inorder traversal
5. Preorder traversal
6. Postorder traversal
7. Print the height of the tree
8. Print the number of elements in the tree
9. Is the binary tree full?
10. Exit the menu loop
